# FTC Dashboard grapher

This is just a simple grapher of the [FTC-Dashboard](https://github.com/acmerobotics/ftc-dashboard) telemetry based on matplotlib.

This is more so a personal project due to my peeves with the Dashboard built-in grapher resetting every time an op-mode was closed and is not really meant to be used as is, but more so as a learning project.
